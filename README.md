# Hundred_Plus_DataScience_Codes

This repository can server as a **serious learning hub** for a learner curious to learn data science principles from **scratch to far-off**. 

The codes are refined continuously. 

The directory structure is: 
- 01_InFiles: the raw input data files used in various scripts
- 02_OutFiles: the output files generated after running some scripts, e.g., graphs, csv files, etc.
- Codes_xx_topic: the directory containing the codes in increasing order of difficulty. `xx` represents serial number and `topic` represents the relevant topic name.
